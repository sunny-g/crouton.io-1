The new image shows a crisp, clear view of Pluto's surface, and it's covered with wide smooth areas, lumpy terrain and mountains. Huge mountains.

"They would stand up respectably against the Rocky Mountains," said John Spencer, a planetary scientist on the New Horizons mission.

The height of the mountains is important because it's a clue that there may be water on Pluto. Scientists know that Pluto's surface is covered with nitrogen ice, methane ice and carbon monoxide ice. But Spencer says, "You can't make mountains out of that stuff. It's too soft."

That leaves H20 -- water ice like we have here on Earth.

"The steep topography means that the bedrock that makes those mountains must be made of H2O -- of water ice," said Stern. "We can be very sure that the water is there in great abundance."

"Who would have supposed that there were ice mountains?" said Hal Weaver, another New Horizons project scientist.

"It's just blowing my mind," he said.

Before New Horizons was launched, scientists thought Pluto probably had a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. But they were having a hard time finding evidence of the water ice, Weaver said. He he expects more data from the spacecraft will confirm that the ice mountains mean there is lots of water on Pluto.

"That's the only way to get these huge mountains, and that's a big surprise I think."

Finding water on another world is important because water is considered one of the key ingredients to life as we know it.

Weaver says they'll learn a lot more about the makeup of Pluto's ice mountains in the days ahead. It will take about 16 months to download all of the information gathered by New Horizon's seven instruments during the flyby.
